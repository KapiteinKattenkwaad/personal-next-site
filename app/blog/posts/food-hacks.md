# Frozen spinach is a gamechanger

This food hack has been a gamechanger, you won't believe number five!
Alright, cut the Buzzfeed clickbait, freezing spinach has been a gamechanger to get some quick iron and fiber in.
Just buy a bag of baby spinach from [Coles](https://www.coles.com.au/product/coles-baby-spinach-60g-1499486) (or whichever shop you prefer) and chuck it in the freezer.

<!-- 1. **Overnight oats**: Prep the night before for a grab-and-go breakfast.
2. **Smoothie packs**: Freeze fruit and greens in bags, blend with milk for a fast meal.
3. **Egg muffins**: Bake eggs and veggies in muffin tins for protein snacks.
4. **One-pan meals**: Toss everything on a tray and bake for easy cleanup.
5. **Bulk cook grains**: Make rice or quinoa for the week and add to meals. -->

<!-- ## Example: Overnight Oats Recipe

```js
const oats = 'rolled oats';
const milk = 'almond milk';
const fruit = 'banana';
const jar = { oats, milk, fruit };
console.log('Refrigerate overnight and enjoy!');
```  -->
