# 5 Food Hacks for Busy Developers

Staying productive means staying fueled! Here are some quick food hacks:

1. **Overnight oats**: Prep the night before for a grab-and-go breakfast.
2. **Smoothie packs**: Freeze fruit and greens in bags, blend with milk for a fast meal.
3. **Egg muffins**: Bake eggs and veggies in muffin tins for protein snacks.
4. **One-pan meals**: Toss everything on a tray and bake for easy cleanup.
5. **Bulk cook grains**: Make rice or quinoa for the week and add to meals.

## Example: Overnight Oats Recipe

```js
const oats = 'rolled oats';
const milk = 'almond milk';
const fruit = 'banana';
const jar = { oats, milk, fruit };
console.log('Refrigerate overnight and enjoy!');
```
