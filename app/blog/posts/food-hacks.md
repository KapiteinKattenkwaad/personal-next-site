# Frozen spinach is a gamechanger

This food hack has been a gamechanger, you won't believe number five!
Alright, cut the Buzzfeed clickbait, freezing spinach has been a gamechanger to get some quick iron and fiber in.
Just buy a bag of baby spinach from [Coles](https://www.coles.com.au/product/coles-baby-spinach-60g-1499486) (or whichever shop you prefer) and chuck it in the freezer.
